= Error codes

Error codes are returned by the server when the execution of a query fails.
The error codes are grouped based on the type of error:

Client errors::
    These errors are caused by the client and are usually related to the request itself.
    Client errors have the prefix `Neo.ClientError`.

Transient errors::
    These errors are detected by the server and are usually related to some kind of database unavailability, such as limits reached, out-of-memory, timeouts, etc.
    The error can be temporary and could therefore succeed if retrying the request.
    Transient errors have the prefix `Neo.TransientError`.

Database errors::
    These errors are caused by the database and are usually related to the database state.
    Database errors have the prefix `Neo.DatabaseError`.
