[[neo4j-errors]]
= Server errors

The Neo4j DBMS returns a server error to indicate that the outcome of a Cypher query or command execution is unsuccessful.
The driver receives these errors and sends them to the client, which displays them to the user.

Starting from version 5.25, the Neo4j error codes have an additional GQL-status object that provides information about the status of a Cypher query or command execution in compliance with the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) - Information technology - Database languages - GQL Standard].

This page describes the GQL-status object and the Neo4j error frameworks, their structure, the objects they provide for errors, and how to interpret them.
It also explains the error internals and the server-driver compatibility for both the GQLSTATUS and legacy errors.

[role=label--version-5.25]
[[gqlstatus-error-object]]
== GQL-status error object

In the GQL-status object framework, errors are an implementation-defined subset of the GQL-status objects that cover exceptions.

In GQL, the execution of a query from user to server always has an outcome, called the _execution outcome_.
The execution outcome is a list of GQL-status objects ordered by the following precedence rules:

. Every exception that results in a transaction rollback takes precedence over other exceptions.
. Every exception takes precedence over any completion condition.

The GQL-status object also includes the Neo4j-specific information, such as the severity level and the error classification.

Each GQL-status object consists of the following fields:

.GQLSTATUS error object
[cols="<1s,<4"]
|===
|GQLSTATUS code
a| A 5-character string that is the concatenation of a 2-character class code followed by a 3-character subclass code.
|StatusDescription
a| A human-readable description of the GQLSTATUS, which consists of a condition, a subcondition, and a description.
The condition and subcondition are textual representations of the class and subclass codes, respectively.
| DiagnosticRecord
a| Extra information about the status, given as key-value pairs, both on the server and driver side.
To retrieve the full diagnostic record, you can use the `diagnosticRecord()` method on both the server and driver sides.
Additional helper methods are exposed for some useful fields.
[cols="<1s,<4"]
!===
! Field ! Description
! `OPERATION` ! The operation that the error is related to. Always defaults to empty.
! `OPERATION_CODE` ! The operation code that the error is related to. Always defaults to `0`.
! `CURRENT_SCHEMA` ! The current schema that the error is related to. Always defaults to `/`.
! `_severity` a! The Neo4j severity level of the error, which is always `ERROR`.
!`_classification` ! The Neo4j error classification, which can be `CLIENT_ERROR`, `TRANSIENT_ERROR`, or `DATABASE_ERROR`.
! `_position` ! The position, given by row and column, where the error is relevant in the query text.
//! `_status_parameters`! A map that contains all variable parts of the status description.
!===
|===

A GQL-status error object can also contain an optional wrapped GQL-status object to provide additional diagnostic information, such as a cause.

[[gqlstatus-neo4j-defined-codes]]
== Classes of GQLSTATUS error codes

The Neo4j GQLSTATUS codes are divided into classes and subclasses.
The class code is a 2-character string that indicates the general condition of the status, such as connection exception, data exception, etc.
The subclass code is a 3-character string that provides more detailed information about the condition.
The Neo4j-define subclasses start with N, followed by a 2-digit number.

The following table lists the GQLSTATUS classes and their meanings:

.GQLSTATUS code classes
[frame="topbot", stripes=odd, grid="cols", cols="<1s,<4"]
|===
|Class
|*Description*

| 08
| connection exception
| 22
| data exception
| 25
| invalid transaction state
| 40
| transaction rollback
| 42
| syntax error or access rule violation
| 50
| general processing exception
| 51
| system configuration or operation exception
| 52
| procedure exception
|===

[[legacy-error-object]]
== Legacy error object

The Neo4j legacy error object contains diagnostic information representing the *unsuccessful* outcome of a Cypher query or command execution, including severity, status code, category, description, message, and position in the query text where the error is relevant.
Depending on the application, some of the fields from the error object might not be visible.

The error object consists of the following fields:

.Neo4j legacy error object
[cols="<1s,<4"]
|===
|Neo4j code
a|The Neo4j status code in the form of `Neo.[Type].[SubType].[Name]`.
|Description
a|The description of the specific error.
|Message
a|The error message.
|Severity level
a|`ERROR`
|Category
a|The category of the error.
Available categories are `CLIENT_ERROR`, `TRANSIENT_ERROR`, and `DATABASE_ERROR`.
|Position
a|The position, given by row and column, where the error is relevant in the query text.
|===

For more information, see the xref:errors/all-errors.adoc[List of legacy server error codes].

[[error-grouping-and-filtering]]
== Server error classification

The fact that an error is returned by the server does not always mean that it is a fatal error.
Status codes can also indicate transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.
The server error classification determines the effect on the transaction.

.Server error classification
[options="header", cols="<1m,<2,<1"]
|===

| Classification
| Description
| Effect on the transaction

| xref:errors/all-errors.adoc#_client_errors[ClientError]
| These errors are caused by the client and are usually related to the request itself.
Changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
Legacy client errors have the prefix `Neo.ClientError`.
| Rollback

| xref:errors/all-errors#_transient_errors[TransientError]
| These errors are detected by the server and are usually related to some kind of database unavailability, such as limits reached, out-of-memory, timeouts, etc.
The error can be temporary, therefore retrying later might yield a successful outcome.
Legacy transient errors have the prefix Neo.`TransientError`.
| Rollback

| xref:errors/all-errors#_database_error[DatabaseError]
| These errors are caused by the database and are usually related to the database state and mean that the database failed to service the request.
Legacy database errors have the prefix `Neo.DatabaseError`.
| Rollback

[[error-internals]]
== Error internals

Neo4j supports server errors in the form of Java exceptions.
Most of these implement the `HasStatus` interface, which means they have a Neo4j status code in addition to the exception message.

On the server side, an exception contains normal Java constructors and methods like `getMessage()`,  `getCause()`, etc., and additionally the `status()` method from the `HasStatus` API, which returns the Neo4j status code.

Starting from 5.25, the exceptions also get new compulsary fields for `gqlStatus` and `statusDescription`, and optional fields for the `diagnosticRecord` and `cause`.
The cause field is a wrapped underlying Neo4j exception, which in turn has its own GQLSTATUS, statusdescription, diagnostic record and message. +
The `getMessage()` method is kept as Java exceptions inherently have this method.
And a new classification field is added to cover the division of client errors, transient errors and database errors, which today is part of the Neo4j status code.
All of these fields construct the GQLSTATUS object, which is sent to the driver as part of the Failure Bolt message.
Exactly how this looks, depends on the combination of driver and server versions.
See <<server-driver-compatibility, Server-driver version compatibility>> for more information.

On the driver side, the Neo4jException is extended with the corresponding methods as on the server side.
The driver receives the failure message and extracts the status code and the error message.
Then, it constructs an error object with the status code, error message, and other relevant information, and sends it to the client.

// Starting from 2025.01, the diagnostic record also contains a `_status_parameters` field, which represens a map that contains all variable parts of the status description, such as labels, database names, Cypher clauses, etc.
// This field is used to provide more detailed information about the error.

== Query logging

Since the query log is server-side and DBMS wide, multiple clients connected to the same DBMS write to the same query log.
As the clients can have separate driver versions, they may have different error framework formats.

In Neo4j 5.25, the default JSON template for the query log is updated to include `errorInfo` entry.
This entry contains `GQLSTATUS`, `statusDescription`, `classification`, `position` (if applicable), and `cause` (if applicable) with the same entries.
//The `failureReason` entry is deprecated from 5.26.

[NOTE]
====
The default GQLSTATUS code 50N42 is returned when an exception does not have a GQL object. Starting from Neo4j 5.25, GQL objects are added to exceptions; therefore, you can expect many 50N42 codes. However, itâ€™s important not to rely on this default code, as future Neo4j versions might change it by adding an appropriate GQL object to the exception. Additionally, GQL codes for external procedures are not yet stable.
====

// Starting from Neo4j 2025.01, a new JSON template is available for the query log, which is the default set in server_log.xml.
// It contains the `errorInfo` entry, but not the `failureReason` entry, which is switched off by default.


[[server-driver-compatibility]]
== Server-driver version compatibility

The server and driver communicate with each other through the Bolt protocol.
During the handshake process, they agree on using the newest possible Bolt protocol version that both the server and the driver support.
For more information on the Bolt versions supported by different server versions, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt-compatibility[Bolt Protocol documentation].
