[[neo4j-errors]]
= Server errors

The Neo4j DBMS returns a server error to indicate that the outcome of a Cypher query or command execution is unsuccessful.
The driver receives these erors and sends them to the Neo4j tools (e.g. Browser, Bloom, Cypher Shell) or the user application, which display them to the user.

Starting from version 5.26, the Neo4j error codes have an additional GQL-status object along with the Neo4j exception that provides information about the status of a Cypher query or command execution in compliance with the link:https://www.iso.org/standard/76120.html[ISO/IEC 39075:2024(en) - Information technology - Database languages - GQL Standard].
This additional GQL-status object is also displayed in the query log from Neo4j 5.25.
For more information, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/monitoring/logging/#gql-error-information[Operations Manual -> GQL error information].

[NOTE]
====
The default GQLSTATUS code 50N42 is returned when an exception does not have a GQL-status object.
Starting from Neo4j 5.25, we started adding GQL objects to exceptions.
Therefore, you can expect many 50N42 codes during this transition period.
However, it is important not to rely on this default code, as future Neo4j versions might change it by adding an appropriate GQL object to the exception.
Additionally, GQL codes for external procedures are not yet stable.

This page describes the GQL-status and the Neo4j-status object frameworks for errors, their structure, the objects they provide for errors, and how to interpret them.
It also explains the error internals and the server-driver compatibility for both the GQLSTATUS and errors.

[[gqlstatus-error-object]]
== GQL-status error object

In the GQL-status object framework, when a user executes a query to the server, it always produces a result known as the _execution outcome_.
If an error occurs during execution, the outcome is recorded as an exception condition, indicating a failed outcome with no result.
The execution outcome for errors is represented as a list of GQL-status objects with a failed outcome, which are organized according to the following precedence rules:

. Every exception that results in a transaction rollback takes precedence over other exceptions.
. Every exception takes precedence over any completion condition.
For completion conditions, see the xref:notifications/index.adoc#gqlstatus-notification-object[GQL-status notification object].

The GQL-status object also includes Neo4j-specific information, such as severity level and error classification.

Each GQL-status object consists of the following fields:

.GQLSTATUS error object
[cols="<1s,<4"]
|===
|GQLSTATUS code
a| A 5-character string that is the concatenation of a 2-character class code followed by a 3-character subclass code, which identifies the condition of the error.
|StatusDescription
a| A human-readable description of the GQLSTATUS, which consists of a condition, a subcondition, and an optional additional text about the condition.
The condition and subcondition are textual representations of the class and subclass codes, respectively.
The format is `error: condition - subcondition. AdditionalInfo`.
The subcondition for the subclass 000 is empty.
| DiagnosticRecord
a| Extra information about the status, given as key-value pairs, both on the server and driver side.
To retrieve the full diagnostic record, you can use the `diagnosticRecord()` on the server side or the corresponding method on the driver sides.
Additional helper methods are exposed for some useful fields.
[cols="<1s,<4"]
!===
! Field ! Description
! `OPERATION` ! The operation that the error is related to. Always defaults to empty.
! `OPERATION_CODE` ! The operation code that the error is related to. Always defaults to `0`.
! `CURRENT_SCHEMA` ! The current schema that the error is related to. Always defaults to `/`.
//! `_severity` a! The Neo4j severity level of the error, which is always `ERROR`.
!`_classification` ! The Neo4j error classification, which can be `CLIENT_ERROR`, `TRANSIENT_ERROR`, or `DATABASE_ERROR`.
! `_position` ! (Optional) The position, given by offset, line and column, where the error is relevant in the query text.
//! `_status_parameters`! A map that contains all variable parts of the status description.
!===
|===

A GQL-status error object can also contain an optional GQL-status object that represents the cause of the error and is used to provide additional, more specific diagnostic information.

[[gqlstatus-neo4j-defined-codes]]
== Classes of GQLSTATUS error codes

The GQLSTATUS codes are divided into classes and subclasses.
The class code is a 2-character string that indicates the general condition of the status, such as connection exception, data exception, etc.
The subclass code is a 3-character string that provides more detailed information about the condition.
//Currently, the Neo4j-defined subclasses start with N or I, followed by a 2-digit number, while the standard-defined subclasses start with 0-4 or A, B, C, D, E, F, G, or H and a 2-digit number.

The following table lists the GQLSTATUS classes and their meanings:

.GQLSTATUS code classes
[frame="topbot", stripes=odd, grid="cols", cols="<1s,<4"]

|Class
|*Condition*

| 08
| connection exception
| 22
| data exception
| 25
| invalid transaction state
| 40
| transaction rollback
| 42
| syntax error or access rule violation

| general processing exception
| 51
| system configuration or operation exception

[[neo4j-error-object]]
== Neo4j-status error object

The Neo4j-status object for errors contains diagnostic information representing the *unsuccessful* outcome of a Cypher query or command execution, including severity, status code, category, description, message, and position in the query text where the error is relevant.
Depending on the application, some of the fields from the error object might not be visible.

The error object consists of the following fields:

.Neo4j error object
[cols="<1s,<4"]
|===
|Neo4j code
a|The Neo4j code in the form of `Neo.[Type].[SubType].[Name]`.
|Description
a|The description of the specific error.
|Message
a|The error message.
|Severity level
a|`ERROR`
|Category
a|The category of the error.
Available categories are `CLIENT_ERROR`, `TRANSIENT_ERROR`, and `DATABASE_ERROR`.
|Position
a|(Optional) The position, given by offset, line and column, where the error is relevant in the query text.
|===

For more information, see the xref:errors/all-errors.adoc[List of Neo4j error codes].

[[error-types]]
== Types of server errors

The fact that an error is returned by the server does not always mean that it is a fatal error.
Status codes can also indicate transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.
The server error group determines the effect on the transaction.

.Server error types
[options="header", cols="<1m,<2,<1"]
|===

| Type
| Description
| Effect on the transaction

| ClientError
| These errors are caused by the client (user input or user application) and are usually related to the request itself.
Changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
 Neo4j codes have the prefix `Neo.ClientError`, while the GQLSTATUS codes have `ErrorClassification` of type `CLIENT_ERROR`.
| Rollback

| TransientError
| These errors are detected by the server and are usually related to some kind of database unavailability, such as limits reached, out-of-memory, timeouts, etc.
The error can be temporary, therefore retrying later might yield a successful outcome.
Neo4j codes have the prefix `Neo.TransientError`, while the GQLSTATUS codes have `ErrorClassification` of type `TRANSIENT_ERROR`.
| Rollback

| DatabaseError
| These errors are caused by the database and are usually related to the database state and mean that the database failed to service the request.
Neo4j codes have the prefix `Neo.DatabaseError`, while the GQLSTATUS codes have `ErrorClassification` of type `DATABASE_ERROR`.
| Rollback

|===

[[error-internals]]
== Error internals

Neo4j supports server errors in the form of Java exceptions.
Most of these implement the `HasStatus` interface, which means they have a status code in addition to the exception message.

On the server side, an exception contains normal Java constructors and methods like `getMessage()`,  `getCause()`, etc., and additionally the `status()` method from the `HasStatus` API, which returns the status code.

The exceptions also get new compulsary fields for `gqlStatus`, `statusDescription`,  `diagnosticRecord`, and an optional field for `cause`.
The cause field in turn has its own GQLSTATUS, status description, diagnostic record, and message. +
The `getMessage()` method is kept as Java exceptions inherently have this method.
And a new classification field is added to cover the division of client errors, transient errors, and database errors, which today is part of the Neo4j code.
All of these fields construct the GQLSTATUS object, which is sent to the driver as part of the Failure Bolt message.
Exactly how this looks, depends on the combination of driver and server versions.
See <<server-driver-compatibility, Server-driver version compatibility>> for more information.

On the driver side, the Neo4jException is extended with the corresponding methods as on the server side.
The driver receives the Failure Bolt message and extracts the status code and the error message.
Then, it constructs an exception with the status code, error message, and other relevant information, and sends it to the client.

// Starting from 2025.01, the diagnostic record also contains a `_status_parameters` field, which represens a map that contains all variable parts of the status description, such as labels, database names, Cypher clauses, etc.
// This field is used to provide more detailed information about the error.

== Query logging

Since the query log is server-side and DBMS wide, multiple clients connected to the same DBMS write to the same query log.
As the clients can have separate driver versions, they may have different error framework formats.

In Neo4j 5.25, the default JSON template for the query log is updated to include an `errorInfo` entry.
This entry contains `GQLSTATUS`, `statusDescription`, `classification`, `position` (if applicable), and `cause` (if applicable) with the same entries.
//The `failureReason` entry is deprecated from ...

// Starting from Neo4j 2025.01, a new JSON template is available for the query log, which is the default set in _server_log.xml_.
// It contains the `errorInfo` entry, but not the `failureReason` entry, which is switched off by default.


[[server-driver-compatibility]]
== Server-driver version compatibility

The server and driver communicate with each other through the Bolt protocol.
During the handshake process, they agree on using the newest possible Bolt protocol version that both the server and the driver support.
For more information on the Bolt versions supported by different server versions, see the link:https://neo4j.com/docs/bolt/current/bolt-compatibility[Bolt Protocol documentation].
