[[error-codes]]
= Server errors

Error codes are Neo4j status codes returned by the server when the execution of a query fails.
They always have the severity level `ERROR`.
Errors are grouped based on the type of the error code:

Client errors::
    These errors are caused by the client and are usually related to the request itself.
    Client errors have the prefix `Neo.ClientError`.

Transient errors::
    These errors are detected by the server and are usually related to some kind of database unavailability, such as limits reached, out-of-memory, timeouts, etc.
    The error can be temporary and could therefore succeed if retrying the request.
    Transient errors have the prefix `Neo.TransientError`.

Database errors::
    These errors are caused by the database and are usually related to the database state.
    Database errors have the prefix `Neo.DatabaseError`.
