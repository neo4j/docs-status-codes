The following page provides an overview of all GQLSTATUS server error codes in Neo4j.
All errors in Neo4j have severity level `ERROR`.

== Connection exceptions

Connection exceptions occur when the client is unable to connect to the server for various reasons such as network issues, server-side routing being disabled, or the database being unavailable, etc.

=== 08000

Status description:: error: connection exception

=== 08007

Status description:: error: connection exception - transaction resolution unknown

=== 08N00

Status description:: error: connection exception - unable to connect to database. Unable to connect to database { $db }. Unable to get bolt address of the leader. Check the status of the database. Retrying your request at a later time may succeed.


=== 08N01

Status description:: error: connection exception - unable to write to database. Unable to write to database { $db } on this server. Server-side routing is disabled. Either connect to the database leader directly or enable server-side routing by setting '{ $cfgSetting }=true'.

//Possible solutions:
//Either connect to the database directly using the driver or interactively with the `:use { $db }` command), or enable server-side routing by setting `dbms.routing.enabled=true` in the configuration.

=== 08N02

Status description:: error: connection exception - unable to connect to database. Unable to connect to database { $db }. Server-side routing is disabled. Either connect to { $db } directly, or enable server-side routing by setting '{ $cfgSetting }=true'.

Example error description:: error: connection exception - unable to route to database. Unable to connect to database `my_db`. Server-side routing is disabled. Either connect to `my_db` directly, or enable server-side routing by setting 'dbms.routing.enabled=true'.

//Possible solutions:
//Either connect to the database directly using the driver or interactively with the `:use { $db }` command), or enable server-side routing by setting `dbms.routing.enabled=true` in the configuration.

=== 08N03

Status description:: error: connection exception - failed to write to graph. Failed to write to graph { $graph }. Check the defined access mode in both driver and database.

=== 08N04

Status description:: error: unable to route use clause. Routing with { $clause } is not supported in embedded sessions. Connect to the database directly or try running the query using a Neo4j driver or the HTTP API.

=== 08N07

Status description:: error: connection exception - not the leader. This member is not the leader.
