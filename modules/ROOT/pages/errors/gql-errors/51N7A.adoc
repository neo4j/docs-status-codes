== Status description
error: system configuration or operation exception - no admin user candidate. No admin user candidate is found. Use `neo4j-admin dbms set-default-admin` to select a valid admin.

== Explanation
When initializing the Neo4j DBMS for the first time, the system attempts to determine a default admin user.
This user is responsible for performing administrative tasks on the database.
If no valid admin user candidate can be found, the system will throw this error.

== Example scenario
For example, before the database starts up for the first time, execute the following command to set a default admin user that does not exist:

[source]
----
neo4j-admin dbms set-default-admin user-that-does-not-exist
----

== Possible solutions

To resolve this issue, run `neo4j-admin dbms set-default-admin` again with a user that does exist in the system.
