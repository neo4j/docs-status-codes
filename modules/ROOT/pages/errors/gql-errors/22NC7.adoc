= 22NC7

== Status description
The independent constraint `{ <<constrDescrOrName>> }` was defined using the same relationship type `{ <<relType>> }` as a relationship type element.

== Explanation
This error occurs when a relationship type is used both as an identifying relaionship type (defining a relationship type element) and as part of an independent constraint.
A label cannot serve as both an identifying label and be referenced in an independent constraint at the same time.

== Example scenario
For example, try to set an existance constraint on a property for the relationship type `:REL`` where `:REL` is also defined as an identifying relationship type in the graph type:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    ()-[:REL => {name :: STRING}]->(),
    CONSTRAINT FOR ()-[r:REL =>]->() REQUIRE r.name IS NOT NULL,
}
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 22NC7 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - independent constraint defined on node type element label. The independent constraint '(:`Person` {`name`})' was defined using the same label `Person` as a node type element.
