= 42NAA

== Status description
error: syntax error or access rule violation - incorrectly formatted graph reference. Incorrectly formatted graph reference `{ <<input>> }`. Expected a single quoted or unquoted identifier. Separate name parts should not be quoted individually.

== Explanation
As of Cypher 25, database names and aliases cannot include name parts that are quoted individually.
Either the whole name must be quoted, or the whole name must be unquoted.

== Example scenario
For example, try to create a database with :

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE `foo`.`bar`
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 42NAA and the status description:

[source]
----
error: syntax error or access rule violation - incorrectly formatted graph reference. Incorrectly formatted graph reference '`foo`.`bar`'. Expected a single quoted or unquoted identifier. Separate name parts should not be quoted individually.
----

In this example scenario, the correct quoting would either be

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE `foo.bar`
----

or

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE DATABASE foo.bar
----
