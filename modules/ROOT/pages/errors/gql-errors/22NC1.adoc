= 22NC1

== Status description
error: data exception - graph type element contains duplicated tokens. The graph type element includes a property key with name `{ <<propKey>> }` more than once.

== Explanation
When defining a graph type, node and relationship element types may only define a property once.

== Example scenario
For example, try to set a graph type as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    (n:Node => {prop::STRING, prop::INTEGER})
}
----

The query returns an error with GQLSTATUS 22NC1 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - graph type element contains duplicated tokens. The graph type element includes a property key with name `prop` more than once.
----

To fix this, remove the duplicate property key definition or uniquely name the property keys:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    (p:Node => {prop :: STRING, prop2 :: INTEGER})
}
----
