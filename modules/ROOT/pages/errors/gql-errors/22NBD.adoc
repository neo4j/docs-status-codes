== Status description
error: data exception - unsupported struct tag. Unsupported struct tag: `{ <<value>> }`.

== Scenario

This error occurs when the server receives a struct tag that it understands but which is not included in the negotiated Bolt protocol version.
This typically means the client driver has added an incorrect struct tag.

== Possible solution

Ensure only valid struct tags are sent for the negotiated protocol version.
