== Status description
error: data exception - unsupported struct tag. Unsupported struct tag: `{ <<value>> }`.

== Scenario

This error will be observed when the server receives a struct tag that it
understands but is not part of the negotiated bolt protocol version. This
typically means the client driver has incorrectly added an incorrect struct tag.

== Possible solution

Ensure only valid struct tags are sent for the negotiated protocol version.
