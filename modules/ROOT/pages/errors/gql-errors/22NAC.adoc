= 22NAC

== Status description
error: data exception - characters after quote in CSV field. Characters after an ending quote in a CSV field are not supported. See `{ <<input>> }` at position `{ <<pos>> }`. This is read as `{ <<variable>> }`.

== Explanation
When a CSV file contains a field that starts with a quote and has content after the ending quote, the file is formatted incorrectly, and trying to read such a file with `LOAD CSV` will result in an error.

== Example scenario

For example, let's say you have a CSV file, called `somefile.csv`, with the following content:

[source,csv]
----
x,y
"x",1
"y"y,2
----

Then, when you run the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV 'somefile.csv' AS line
RETURN count(line)
----

you will receive an error with GQLSTATUS 22NAC and status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - characters after quote in CSV field. Characters after an ending quote in a CSV field are not supported. See 'somefile.csv' at position 14. This is read as `y"y` .
