== Status description
error: connection exception - unable to write to database. Unable to write to database `{ $db }` on this server. Server-side routing is disabled. Either connect to the database leader directly or enable server-side routing by setting '{ $cfgSetting }=true'.



== Possible solution
Either connect to the database directly using the driver or interactively with the `:use mydb` command), or enable server-side routing by setting `dbms.routing.enabled=true` in the configuration.
