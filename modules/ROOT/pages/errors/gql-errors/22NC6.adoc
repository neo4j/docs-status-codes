= 22NC6

== Status description
The independent constraint `{ <<constrDescrOrName>> }`` was defined using the same label `{ <<label>> }` as a node type element.

== Explanation
This error occurs when a label is used both as an identifying label (defining a node type element) and as part of an independent constraint.
A label cannot serve as both an identifying label and be referenced in an independent constraint at the same time.

== Example scenario
For example, try to set an existance constraint on a property for the label `:Person`` where `:Person` is also defined as an identifying label in the graph type:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    (p:Person => {name :: STRING}),
    CONSTRAINT FOR (p:Person =>) REQUIRE p.name IS NOT NULL,
}
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 22NC6 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - independent constraint defined on node type element label. The independent constraint '(:`Person` {`name`})' was defined using the same label `Person` as a node type element.
