== Status description
error: system configuration or operation exception - not supported with auth disabled. The command `{ <<cmd>> }` is not available with auth disabled.

== Explanation
This error occurs when auth is disabled and a user attempts to run a command that isn't available unless auth is enabled.

== Example scenario
For example, trying to change the current users password when auth is disabled:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD FROM $oldPassword TO $newPassword
----

Error message will be:

[source]
----
error: system configuration or operation exception - not supported with auth disabled. The command 'ALTER CURRENT USER SET PASSWORD' is not available with auth disabled.
----

To fix this, either enable auth or change the password using the `ALTER USER` command:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT USER $currentUsername SET PASSWORD $newPassword CHANGE NOT REQUIRED
----
