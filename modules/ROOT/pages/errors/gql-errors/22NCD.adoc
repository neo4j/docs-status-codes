= 22NCD

== Status description
error: data exception - relationship element type specified incorrectly. The relationship element type identified by the relationship type `{ <<relType>> }` is different to the one specified in the query.

== Explanation

== Example scenario

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    ()-[r:REL => {name :: STRING }]->()
}
----

Execute the query:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE DROP {
     ()-[r:REL => {name :: STRING, age :: INT }]->()
}
----

The query returns an error with GQLSTATUS 22NCD and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - relationship element type specified incorrectly. The relationship element type identified by the relationship type `REL` is different to the one specified in the query.
----

To fix this, change the query as follows:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE DROP {
     ()-[r:REL => ]->()
}
----
It is not necessary to specify the full element type to drop it.
