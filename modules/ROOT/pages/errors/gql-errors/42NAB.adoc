= 42NAB

== Status description
error: syntax error or access rule violation - not supported standalone call. WHERE is not supported in a standalone call. Use `CALL ... YIELD ... WHERE ... RETURN ...` instead.

== Explanation
A standalone call of a procedure does not support a `WHERE` clause, i.e., it does not support the filtering of the procedure result.
Either remove the `WHERE` clause or add a `RETURN` clause after the call to turn it into an in-query call.

== Example scenario
For example, trying to filter the result of the procedure `db.labels()` in a standalone call:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.labels() YIELD label WHERE label <> 'A'
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 42NAB and the following status description:

[source]
----
error: syntax error or access rule violation - not supported standalone call. WHERE is not supported in a standalone call. Use `CALL ... YIELD ... WHERE ... RETURN ...` instead.
----

== Possible solutions

You can abstain from filtering to get a valid query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.labels() YIELD label
----

However, if you still want to filter the result of the procedure `db.labels()`, you can add a `RETURN` clause:

.Query
[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.labels() YIELD label WHERE label <> 'A' RETURN label
----
