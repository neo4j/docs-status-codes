== Status description

error: syntax error or access rule violation - cannot call function from this context. The function `{ <<fun>> }` cannot be called from the current context. It can only be used `{ <<context>> }`.

== Explanation
This error is thrown when a function is called from a context that is not allowed for that function.

== Example scenario
If you try to call an internal security function like `abac.oidc.user_attribute()` from a regular Cypher query, you will get this error, because it is not supported in user Cypher queries and can only be called from within `AUTH RULE` creation or alteration commands.
