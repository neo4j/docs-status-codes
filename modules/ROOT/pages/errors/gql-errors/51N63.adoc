== Status description
error: system configuration or operation exception - index is still populating. Index `{ <<idx>> }` is not ready yet. Wait until it finishes populating and retry the transaction.

== Explanation
An index cannot be used while its `state` is `POPULATING`, which occurs immediately after it is created.
To check the `state` of an index -- whether it is `ONLINE` (usable) or `POPULATING` (still being built; the `populationPercent` column shows the progress of the index creation) -- run the following command: `SHOW INDEXES`.
To wait for an index to come online, see procedures link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/2025.12/procedures/#procedure_db_awaitIndex[db.awaitIndex()] and link:https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/2025.12/procedures/#procedure_db_awaitIndexes[db.awaitIndexes()].
