= 22NAD

== Status description
error: data exception - missing end quote in CSV field. Missing end quote at position `{ <<pos>> }` in `{ <<input>> }`.

== Explanation
When a CSV file contains a field that starts with a quote but misses an ending quote, the file is formatted incorrectly and trying to read such a file with `LOAD CSV` will result in an error.

== Example scenario

For example, let's say you have a CSV file, called `somefile.csv`, with the following content:

[source,csv]
----
x,y
"x",1
"y,2
----

Then, when you run the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
LOAD CSV 'somefile.csv' AS line
RETURN count(line)
----

you will receive an error with GQLSTATUS 22NAD and status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - missing end quote in CSV field. Missing end quote at position 15 in 'somefile.csv'.
