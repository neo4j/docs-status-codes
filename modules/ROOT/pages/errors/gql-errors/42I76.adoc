== Status description
error: syntax error or access rule violation - index or constraint value too long. The provided index or constraint `{ <<item>> }` `{ <<input>> }` (`{ <<bytes>> }` bytes) exceeded limit of `{ <<bytes>> }` bytes.

== Example scenario

For example, with a Neo4j 2026.01 binary running an earlier kernel version, on a block-format database. When creating an index with a very large name `$largeIndexName` which would be a little under 8KiB or more when UTF-8 encoded.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX $largeIndexName
FOR (n:Person) ON (n.name)
----

Where provided name `$largeIndexName` would be approximate 8KiB long, and start with the following:

[source]
----
:param largeIndexName => `A very long index name that would be encoded to around 8KiB of UTF-8 encoded data should ideally be gracefully handled, etc...`
----

You will receive an error with GQLSTATUS xref:errors/gql-errors/42I76.adoc[42I76].
