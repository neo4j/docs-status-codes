== Status description
error: data exception - relationship element type has no effect. The relationship element type `{ <<relType>> }` must define a source, destination, or at least one property type.

== Explanation
When defining a graph type, relationship element types must have some effect.
To be effective, a relationship element type must define at least one of the following:

* a source node element type or label
* a destination node element type or label
* at least one property type

== Example scenario
For example, try to set a graph type as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    ()-[:REL =>]->()
}
----

The query returns an error with GQLSTATUS 22NC3 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - relationship element type has no effect. The relationship element type `REL` must define a source or destination, or at least one property type.
----

To fix this, define at least one property type or add a node element type, for example:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    ()-[:REL => {prop: ANY NOT NULL }]->()
}
----
