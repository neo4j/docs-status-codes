= 22NC2

== Status description
error: data exception - node element type has no effect. The node element type `{ <<label>> }` must contain one or more implied labels, or at least one property type.

== Explanation
When defining a graph type, node element types must have some effect; otherwise, they are not allowed.

== Example scenario
For example, try to set a graph type as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    (n:Node => )
}
----

The query returns an error with GQLSTATUS 22NC2 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - node element type is has no effect. The node element type `Node` must contain one or more implied labels, or at least one property type.
----

To fix this, define at least one property type or add an implied label, for example:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    (n:Node => { prop :: ANY NOT NULL })
}
----
