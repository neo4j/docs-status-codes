= 22NC8

== Status description
The empty node type `()` is not a valid target for a constraint

== Explanation
This error occurs when you attempt to define a constraint on an empty node type.
Constraints must target specific node types using a label.
Using an empty node type means there is no label or type specified, which is not valid for constraint definitions.

== Example scenario
Attempt to define a constraint on an empty node reference as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    CONSTRAINT FOR () REQUIRE n.badger IS UNIQUE
}
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 22NC8 and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - constraint does not have a label or relationship type. The empty node type `()` is not a valid target for a constraint.
