= 22NCB

== Status description
error: data exception - relationship element type already exists. A relationship element type identified by the relationship type `{ <<relType>> }` already exists in the graph type.

== Explanation

This error occurs when attempting to add a new relationship element type to the graph type, but a relationship element type with the same type already exists.

== Example scenario

Given the existing graph type:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    ()-[r:REL => {name :: STRING }]->()
}
----

Execute the query:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE ADD {
     ()-[r:REL => {name :: STRING, age :: INT }]->()
}
----

The query returns an error with GQLSTATUS 22NCB and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - relationship element type already exists. A relationship element type identified by the relationship type `REL` already exists in the graph type.
----

To fix this, change the query as follows:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE ALTER {
     ()-[r:REL => {name :: STRING, age :: INT }]->()
}
----
