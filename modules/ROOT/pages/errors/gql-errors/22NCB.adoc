= 22NCB

== Status description
The graph type constraint is missing an alias.

== Explanation
Attempting to define a constraint against a node that is not using an alias, such as `:Node`, will cause this error.
The constraint must be defined against an element type alias, for example, `n:Node`.

== Example scenario
Attempt to define an existance constraint as follows:

[source,cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    CONSTRAINT FOR (:Node) REQUIRE n.prop IS NOT NULL
}
----

An error will be thrown with GQLSTATUS 22NCB and the status description:

[source]
----
error: data exception - invalid element type constraints in graph type. A node element type property existence constraint cannot be specified inline of a node element type.
----

A correct definition is as follows:

[source, cypher]
----
ALTER CURRENT GRAPH TYPE SET {
    CONSTRAINT FOR (n:Node) REQUIRE n.prop IS NOT NULL
}
----
