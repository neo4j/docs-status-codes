:description: The legacy error codes for Neo4j 5.


[[neo4j-errors]]
= List of legacy server error codes

This page lists the legacy server error codes, also known as Neo4j status codes.
These will be replaced by xref:errors/gql-errors.adoc[GQLSTATUS server error codes].

Neo4j status codes are returned by the server when the execution of a query fails.
They always have the severity level `ERROR`.
Errors are grouped based on the type of the Neo4j status code:

Client errors::
These errors are caused by the client and are usually related to the request itself.
The Neo4j status code for client errors have the prefix `Neo.ClientError`.

Transient errors::
These errors are detected by the server and are usually related to some kind of database unavailability, such as limits reached, out-of-memory, timeouts, etc.
The error can be temporary, and the request could succeed if retried.
The Neo4j status code for transient errors have the prefix Neo.`TransientError`.

Database errors::
These errors are caused by the database and are usually related to the database state.
Database errors have the prefix `Neo.DatabaseError`.

This page contains lists of all Neo4j errors, grouped by type.

== Client errors

This is a complete list of all client errors Neo4j may return, and what they mean.

For instance, a transaction that has had schema modifications performed in it cannot be used to subsequently perform data operations, and vice versa.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.InvalidBookmark
|
The supplied bookmark cannot be interpreted.
You should only supply a bookmark that was previously generated by Neo4j.
Maybe you have generated your own bookmark, or modified a bookmark since it was generated by Neo4j.

| Neo4j status code
| Description

| Neo.TransientError.ChangeDataCapture.FutureIdentifier
| Change identifier points to a future transaction that has not yet happened on this database instance.

| Neo.TransientError.Cluster.ReplicationFailure
| Replication failure.

|
The memory pool limit was exceeded.
The corresponding setting can be found in the error message.

| Neo.TransientError.General.OutOfMemoryError
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `server.memory.heap.max_size` in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface).

If you are running an embedded installation, you can increase the heap by using the `-Xmx` command line flag, and then restart the database.

| Neo.TransientError.General.StackOverFlowError
|
There is not enough stack size to perform the current task.
This is generally considered to be a database error, so please contact Neo4j support.

You could try increasing the stack size; for example to set the stack size to `2M`, add `server.jvm.additional=-Xss2M` to in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface).

 If you are running an embedded installation, you can add `-Xss2M` as command line flag.

|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `server.memory.off_heap.transaction_max_size` in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface), and then restart the database.
