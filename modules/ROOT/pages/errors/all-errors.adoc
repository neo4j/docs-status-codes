You should only supply a bookmark that was previously generated by Neo4j.
Maybe you have generated your own bookmark, or modified a bookmark since it was generated by Neo4j.

== Transient errors

This is a complete list of all transient errors Neo4j may return, and what they mean.

[options="header", cols="<1m,<1"]
|===

| Neo4j status code
| Description

| Neo.TransientError.ChangeDataCapture.FutureIdentifier
| Change identifier points to a future transaction that has not yet happened on this database instance.

| Neo.TransientError.Cluster.ReplicationFailure
| Replication failure.

| Neo.TransientError.General.DatabaseUnavailable
|
The database is not currently available to serve your request, refer to the database logs for more details.
Retrying your request at a later time may succeed.

| Neo.TransientError.General.MemoryPoolOutOfMemoryError
|
The memory pool limit was exceeded.
The corresponding setting can be found in the error message.

| Neo.TransientError.General.OutOfMemoryError
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `server.memory.heap.max_size` in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface).

If you are running an embedded installation, you can increase the heap by using the `-Xmx` command line flag, and then restart the database.

| Neo.TransientError.General.StackOverFlowError
|
There is not enough stack size to perform the current task.
This is generally considered to be a database error, so please contact Neo4j support.

You could try increasing the stack size; for example to set the stack size to `2M`, add `server.jvm.additional=-Xss2M` to in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface).

 If you are running an embedded installation, you can add `-Xss2M` as command line flag.

| Neo.TransientError.General.TransactionMemoryLimit
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `server.memory.off_heap.transaction_max_size` in the Neo4j configuration file (normally in _conf/neo4j.conf_ or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface), and then restart the database.
