= Changes and deprecations


== 2025.04

Using the error messages programmatically is deprecated.
Because error messages might change in a future release, please parse or use GQLSTATUS error codes in your application code.
For details, see xref:errors/gql-errors/index.adoc[GQLSTATUS error codes].


== 2025.01

* The diagnostic record also contains a `_status_parameters` field, which represents a map that contains all variable parts of the status description, such as labels, database names, Cypher clauses, etc.
This field is used to provide more detailed information about the error.

* A new JSON template is available for the query log, which is the default set in _server_log.xml_.
It contains the `errorInfo` entry, but not the `failureReason` entry, which is switched off by default.
