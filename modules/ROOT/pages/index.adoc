The Neo4j status codes for Neo4j v{neo4j-version}.

Each status code follows the same format:

[source, status code format, role="noheader"]
-----
Neo.[Classification].[Category].[Title]
-----

The fact that a status code is returned by the server does always mean there is a fatal error.
Status codes can also indicate transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.

What the effect of the status code is can be determined by the classification.


== Classifications

[options="header", cols="<1m,<3,<1"]
|===

| Classification
| Description
| Effect on transaction 

| ClientError
| The Client sent a bad request - changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
| Rollback

| ClientNotification
| There are notifications about the request sent by the client.
| None

| TransientError
| The database cannot service the request right now, retrying later might yield a successful outcome.
| Rollback 

| DatabaseError
| The database failed to service the request.
| Rollback

This is a complete list of all client error status codes Neo4j may return, and what they mean.

[options="header", cols="<1m,<1"]
|===

| Status Code
| Description

| Neo.ClientError.Cluster.NotALeader
| The request cannot be processed by this server. Write requests can only be processed by the leader.

| Neo.ClientError.Cluster.Routing

| The request referred to a database with an alias.

| Neo.ClientError.Database.ExistingDatabaseFound
| The request referred to a database that already exists.

| Neo.ClientError.Fabric.AccessMode

| The request contained fields that were empty or are not allowed.

| Neo.ClientError.General.TransactionOutOfMemoryError
|
The transaction used more memory than was allowed.
The maximum allowed size for a transaction can be configured with 'dbms.memory.transaction.max_size' in the neo4j configuration (normally in 'conf/neo4j.conf' or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface).

|
Failed to invoke a procedure.
See the detailed error description for exact cause.

Tokens cannot be empty strings and cannot be null.

| Neo.ClientError.Security.AuthenticationRateLimit

| This administration command is not supported.

| Neo.ClientError.Statement.UnsupportedOperationError
| This query preformed an operation that is not supported in this context.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.ForbiddenDueToTransactionType
|
The transaction is of the wrong type to service the request.
For instance, a transaction that has had schema modifications performed in it cannot be used to subsequently perform data operations, and vice versa.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.InvalidBookmark
|
Supplied bookmark cannot be interpreted.
You should only supply a bookmark that was previously generated by Neo4j.
Maybe you have generated your own bookmark, or modified a bookmark since it was generated by Neo4j.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.InvalidBookmarkMixture
|
Mixing bookmarks generated by different databases is forbidden.
You should only chain bookmarks that are generated from the same database.
You may however chain bookmarks generated from system database with bookmarks from another database.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.LockClientStopped
| The transaction has been terminated, so no more locks can be acquired.
This can occur because the transaction ran longer than the configured transaction timeout,
or because a human operator manually terminated the transaction, or because the database is shutting down.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.Terminated

|
Transaction was marked as both successful and failed.
Failure takes precedence and so this transaction was rolled back although it may have looked like it was going to be committed.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.TransactionNotFound
| The request referred to a transaction that does not exist.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.TransactionTimedOut
|
The transaction has not completed within the specified timeout (`dbms.transaction.timeout`).
You may want to retry with a longer timeout.

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.TransactionValidationFailed
| Transaction changes did not pass validation checks.

| The execution plan for this query contains the Eager operator, which forces all dependent data to be materialized in main memory before proceeding

| Neo.ClientNotification.Statement.ExhaustiveShortestPath

|
The memory pool limit was exceeded.
The corresponding setting can be found in the error message.

| Neo.TransientError.General.OutOfMemoryError
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `dbms.memory.heap.max_size` in the neo4j configuration (normally in `conf/neo4j.conf` or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface) or if you are running an embedded installation increase the heap by using `-Xmx` command line flag, and then restart the database.

| Neo.TransientError.General.StackOverFlowError
|
There is not enough stack size to perform the current task.
This is generally considered to be a database error, so please contact Neo4j support.
You could try increasing the stack size: for example to set the stack size to `2M`, add `dbms.jvm.additional=-Xss2M` to in the neo4j configuration (normally in `conf/neo4j.conf` or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface) or if you are running an embedded installation just add `-Xss2M` as command line flag.

| Neo.TransientError.General.TransactionMemoryLimit
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `dbms.memory.off_heap.max_size` in the neo4j configuration (normally in `conf/neo4j.conf` or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface), and then restart the database.
