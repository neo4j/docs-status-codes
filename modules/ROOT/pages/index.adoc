= Neo4j Status Codes v5

This document details all status codes that a Neo4j DBMS may return to indicate the outcome of a request.

== Format

Each status code follows the same format:

[source, status code format, role="noheader"]
-----
Neo.[Class].[Subclass].[Name]
-----

== Classification

The fact that a status code is returned by the server does not always mean there is a fatal error.
Status codes can also indicate transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.
The classification of the status code determines the effect on the transaction.
