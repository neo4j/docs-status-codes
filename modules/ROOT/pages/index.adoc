The Neo4j status codes for Neo4j v{neo4j-version}.

Each status code follows the same format:

[source, status code format, role="noheader"]
-----
Neo.[Classification].[Category].[Title]
-----

The fact that a status code is returned by the server does always mean there is a fatal error.
Status codes can also indicate transient problems that may go away if you retry the request.

What the effect of the status code is can be determined by the classification.


== Classifications

[options="header", cols="<1m,<3,<1"]
|===

| Classification
| Description
| Effect on transaction 

| ClientError
| The Client sent a bad request - changing the request might yield a successful outcome.
| Rollback

| ClientNotification
| There are notifications about the request sent by the client.
| None

| TransientError
| The database cannot service the request right now, retrying later might yield a successful outcome.
| Rollback

[options="header", cols="<1m,<1"]
|===

| Status Code
| Description 

| Neo.ClientError.Cluster.NotALeader
| The request cannot be processed by this server. Write requests can only be processed by the leader. 

| Neo.ClientError.Cluster.Routing
| Unable to route the request to the appropriate server 

| Neo.ClientError.Database.DatabaseNotFound
| The request referred to a database that does not exist. 

| Neo.ClientError.Database.ExistingDatabaseFound
| The request referred to a database that already exists. 

| Neo.ClientError.Fabric.AccessMode

| Neo.ClientError.General.InvalidArguments
| The request contained fields that were empty or are not allowed. 

| Neo.ClientError.General.TransactionOutOfMemoryError
|
The transaction used more memory than was allowed.
The maximum allowed size for a transaction can be configured with 'dbms.memory.transaction.max_size' in the neo4j configuration (normally in 'conf/neo4j.conf' or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface). 

| Neo.ClientError.General.UpgradeRequired
|
This transaction required database to be of a higher kernel version than it is.
Make sure that dbms has been correctly upgraded before retrying this operation. 

| Neo.ClientError.Procedure.ProcedureCallFailed
|
Failed to invoke a procedure.
See the detailed error description for exact cause.

| The database failed to register a procedure, refer to the associated error message for details. 

| Neo.ClientError.Procedure.ProcedureTimedOut

| Neo.ClientError.Schema.EquivalentSchemaRuleAlreadyExists
| Unable to perform operation because an equivalent schema rule already exists. 

| Neo.ClientError.Schema.ForbiddenOnConstraintIndex
|
A requested operation can not be performed on the specified index because the index is part of a constraint.
If you want to drop the index, for instance, you must drop the constraint. 

| Neo.ClientError.Schema.IndexAlreadyExists

| Neo.ClientError.Statement.UnsupportedAdministrationCommand
| This administration command is not supported. 

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.ForbiddenDueToTransactionType

For instance, a transaction that has had schema modifications performed in it cannot be used to subsequently perform data operations, and vice versa. 

| Neo.ClientError.Transaction.InvalidBookmark
|

| Neo.ClientNotification.Statement.ExhaustiveShortestPathWarning
|

Hence an exhaustive enumeration of all paths might be used in order to find the requested shortest path.

There is not enough memory to perform the current task.
Please try increasing `dbms.memory.heap.max_size` in the neo4j configuration (normally in `conf/neo4j.conf` or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface) or if you are running an embedded installation increase the heap by using `-Xmx` command line flag, and then restart the database. 

| Neo.TransientError.General.StackOverFlowError
|
There is not enough stack size to perform the current task.
This is generally considered to be a database error, so please contact Neo4j support.
You could try increasing the stack size: for example to set the stack size to `2M`, add `dbms.jvm.additional=-Xss2M` to in the neo4j configuration (normally in `conf/neo4j.conf` or, if you are using Neo4j Desktop, found through the user interface) or if you are running an embedded installation just add `-Xss2M` as command line flag.

| Neo.TransientError.General.TransactionMemoryLimit
|
There is not enough memory to perform the current task.

Retrying this transaction will most likely be successful. 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.Interrupted
| Interrupted while waiting. 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.LeaseExpired
| The lease under which this transaction was started is no longer valid. 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.LockAcquisitionTimeout
| Unable to acquire lock within configured timeout (`dbms.lock.acquisition.timeout`). 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.LockClientStopped
|
The transaction has been terminated, so no more locks can be acquired.
This can occur because the transaction ran longer than the configured transaction timeout, or because a human operator manually terminated the transaction, or because the database is shutting down. 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.MaximumTransactionLimitReached
|
Unable to start new transaction since the maximum number of concurrently executing transactions is reached (`dbms.transaction.concurrent.maximum`).
You can retry at a later time or consider increasing allowed maximum of concurrent transactions. 

| Neo.TransientError.Transaction.Outdated
|
Transaction has seen state which has been invalidated by applied updates while transaction was active.
Transaction may succeed if retried.
